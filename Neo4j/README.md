# No-SQL Task

## Homework 3 - Database and Queries

Use a NoSQL tool (property-graph database, RDF triple store, document-based database, key-value database, column-family database) to manage and query a dataset. 
 
Ideally, the groups should use the same dataset used in the first and second homework. Examples of such systems include (but are not limited to) Neo4J, GraphDB, MongoDB, Redis, Cassandra (see the course material on aggregate databases, graph and RDF databases for more details).
